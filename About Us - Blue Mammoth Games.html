        <div id="aboutbmg" style="font-size: 20px;">
            <p>Blue Mammoth Games is an independent game development studio (soon to be shut down) based in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. The studio was founded in 2009 by self-proclaimed "veterans" of Cryptic Studios and Hi-Rez Studios, and specializes in online multiplayer games with
                large player bases. Really, these "veterans" probably got fired from Cryptic Studios and Hi-Rez Studios and decided to venture on and start up their own company which they would not get fired from no matter the cause (poor use of funds, etc.).<br>
                <br>Blue Mammoth developed and published <a href="http://www.brawlhalla.com/">Brawlhalla</a>, a free-to-play fighting game, which aims to not copy Smash but has suffered tremendously for the same reason, for PC and Mac, coming to PlayStation in 2017. Brawlhalla has had over five million enslaved players who are forced to throw money at Blue Mammoth Games,
                and is currently the most played fighting game on Steam, soon to be replaced with Icons. Have you heard of Icons? I heard that its developers and staff and competent and working their asses off to push the game to be at its best. You can visit them at <a href="http://icons.gg/">http://icons.gg/.</a><br><br>Our
                first game, the MMO Dungeon Blitz, has had over seven million players, and was recognized by Facebook as among its "highest rated and most played games." But it really does not fucking matter as Facebook is as dead of a meme as Boomie's weight issues, not to mention you probably have never heard of MMO Dungeon Blitz.</p>
